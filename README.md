# StreamIt

A no-nonsense streaming radio player using [LibVLC](https://github.com/videolan/libvlcsharp).

This is probably not what you're looking for. I did it for me, and I had fun.

I have a couple streaming radio stations I cycle through at work, and I was tired of looking at VLC's outdated UI and didn't need all of the other features it provides. I also wanted to add some features I couldn't find, specific to streaming, like pulling out the stream metadata to make a list of songs that have been played. I'm not a great designer but I tried to make something modern and visually pleasing.

Some of the features:
 - Big tiles, with album art from currently-playing song, representing each station.
 - Stations can be tagged with keywords for searching
 - Quick search (hit '/' and start typing) through station titles and tags
 - Volume control & mute button
 - Songs played, along with their artist and album art, are listed for each station. Tapping the entry searches the song title, artist or album.
